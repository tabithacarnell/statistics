# Statistics Coursework â€“ MSc Data Science & AI

This repository showcases three coursework projects submitted for the *Statistics for AI and Data Science* module at Queen Mary University of London. Each task focuses on applying statistical techniques to real-world data using Python, with an emphasis on practical analysis, interpretation and critical thinking.
